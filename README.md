# StringCalculatorKata

This repository contains my implementation of the String Calculator Kata, a programming exercise aimed at practicing TDD (Test-Driven Development) and basic algorithmic problem-solving skills. The String Calculator Kata involves creating a simple calculator that can handle string inputs representing mathematical expressions. Through this project, I explore various approaches to parsing, evaluating, and calculating arithmetic operations on strings, while adhering to the principles of clean code and efficient algorithm design.
